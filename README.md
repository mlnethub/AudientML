# AudientML
A model that predicts genre from input features such as MFCC, spectral and other features. Implemented in ML.NET.

## TODO:
* Train with keras.layers.GaussianNoise(stddev)?
* Try other models and variations.
* Normalize the training data for real life values. (Noise, frequency spectrum of the recording device, etc)
